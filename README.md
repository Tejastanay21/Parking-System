# Parking-System

The project is based on designing a parking system that will help the car parking watchman to keep track record of all the vehicles in the parking. A person can select the category of vehicle(car, rickshaw, bus, etc) from the list of options available and then he can obtain the the charging amount of vehicle and the count of each vehicle. This system will ease the job for the respective person.
